* Updated to match the latest RHEL 7 guidelines from SAP
* Added notify check for swap partition size

* Added test to ensure an SID is specified
* Added management of default mount point creation for 'base' and 'db2' components
* Added a top-level configuration of SID string replacement patterns

**Bugfixes**
* Expanded the yum groups to actual package names to avoid constant service restarts
* Corrected the root cause of the restarts by specifying the uuidd.socket service instead of just uuidd.service. This is due to systemctl shenanigans as described in [PUP-6759](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-6759)
